## This project has moved ##

We're in the process of moving away from our Google Code page. The latest and greatest information can be found on [our homepage](http://www.2cloudproject.com), and our code (starting with the 2.1 release) will be moved to [our Github page](http://www.github.com/2cloud). This page will be kept up for archival reasons.

## The Project ##

android2cloud was born from the 2010 Google I/O demo, in which Froyo was demonstrated. Froyo has a cool cloud-to-android push functionality, in which you can use an extension in chrome (or anything else really) and push the current webpage directly to your Android phone, which will react intelligently.

android2cloud was meant to fill the other half of that relationship. When using your android device, it is easy to come across long articles or things not suited for viewing on a phone. android2cloud answers to the "Share" intent on android, allowing you to push those articles and webpages to your browser with the push of a button.

The extension can be found [here](http://links.2cloudproject.com/chromewebstore). The application is listed in the Android marketplace as "2cloud". There is a donation app in the marketplace that is identical, and also a link on the side panel. Donations help us offer these apps for free, so thank you to everyone who has spared some change.

Make sure to check out [the blog](http://blog.android2cloud.org/) or [the Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/2cloudproject) to keep up to date with all the developments.

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our sponsors, [WonderProxy](http://www.wonderproxy.com/) and [SiteSpect](http://www.sitespect.com/), for helping to keep our servers online. If you're looking to test GeoIP apps from around the world, give WonderProxy a look. If you want A/B or multivariate testing, SiteSpect has some non-intrusive solutions for you. The staff for these companies are great-- we know from experience. :)
