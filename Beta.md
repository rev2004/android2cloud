# About Beta Testing #

We try our best to write quality, bug-free software from the get-go. Sometimes, though, a few bugs squeak past us. To that end, we try to have a limited release to users, with the understanding that things may break. These users help us to find the lingering bugs, and iron them out before we release the software to all of our users.
