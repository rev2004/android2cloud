Please note, this policy can only apply to android2cloud applications distributed by Paddy Foran in the market, in Chrome's Extension gallery, or downloaded from this site. If you get this software from another party (we encourage redistribution or modification) you need to inquire as to _their_ privacy policy, as we cannot vouch for them. We apologise for this inconvenience.

# Privacy #

By authorizing this software to use your Google account, you are authorizing it to check your login credentials with Google, and to store your Google username. At no point will any other information be accessed from Google. Your password will never be accessed or stored by our software.

As of 0.2, the Android application contains some Google Analytics tracking code. This will gather information about your location, operating system, and app usage, which will be made available to the developer. Any information gathered in this manner is completely anonymous, and will be used only to better your experience with the application.

Information gathered by this software (including, but not limited to, your username and any links you may send using it) may be accessed by the developer for the purposes of debugging the application, or for contacting users under extreme situations. Until we are legally compelled to do so, your information will not be disclosed to any third party for any reason.

If you are concerned for your privacy, we encourage you to download the source, and set up your own Google App Engine server, a simple process that takes roughly five minutes. At that point, you will own all your data, and the developer(s) will not be collecting or accessing any data pertaining to your account. For help with setting up your own server, please don't hesitate to use our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/android2cloud).
